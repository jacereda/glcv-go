Wrapper for the [GLCV](https://bitbucket.org/jacereda/glcv) library.

GLCV is a small canvas/event handling library that provides a thin
layer abstracting the details of configuring the window and handling
input. Sort of a simple GLUT/SDL. No API is provided for
sound/fonts/widgets, there are good solutions out there for those and
freedom of choice is a good thing.
